# fractal-generator
An implementation of the escape-time algorithm for the Mandelbrot set. Generates a bitmap image with histogram coloring based on user-given color ranges and zoom levels specified in main.

This program depends on the SDL library in order to display the fractal. You can run the code yourself, but you will have to install SDL2 and include the header files and libraries in your C++ build path to do so. I hope to bundle this all with an installer at some point.
